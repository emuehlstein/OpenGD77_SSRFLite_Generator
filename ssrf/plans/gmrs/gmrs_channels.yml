    notes: |
      GMRS simplex permitted on 462 MHz interstitial (Ch 1-7) and main 462 MHz (Ch 15-22). 
      467 MHz interstitial (Ch 8-14) are FRS-only simplex; GMRS licensees should not transmit on these frequencies 
      except as repeater inputs where authorized. Marked as Rx-only here for GMRS use.
